# Test shuffler

A Python script that creates different variations of a test type. It shuffles both the order of questions and the order of possible answers.


## Usage/Examples

The questions should be located in the file 'questions.txt'. Each question consists of 5 lines, the first line being the statement, followed by the four possible options. The option beginning with the character '.' will be the one taken as correct.
